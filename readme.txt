CP Google Maps allows to associate geolocation information to your posts and to integrate your blog with Google Maps in an easy and natural way.

== Description ==

Google Map features:

	► Insert a Google map in the best position within your blog
	► Deal with large volumes of dots or markers on the Google Maps

**CP Google Maps** allows to insert a Google Maps in a post or in any of the WordPress templates that display multiple posts.

Note 1: To display all points that belong to a specific category, it is required to insert the following shortcode [codepeople-post-map cat="3"]. The number 3 represent the category ID, replace this number by the corresponding category's ID. To insert the code directly in a template, the snippet of code is:

            <?php echo do_shortcode('[codepeople-post-map cat="3"]'); ?>
			
Note 2:	To display all points that belong to more than one category, separate the categories IDs with the comma symbol [codepeople-post-map cat="3,5"]. The numbers 3 y 5 are the categories IDs, replace these numbers by the corresponding categories IDs. To insert the code directly in a template, the snippet of code is:

            <?php echo do_shortcode('[codepeople-post-map cat="3,5"]'); ?>
            
Note 3: To display all points in the website, use -1 as the category's ID: [codepeople-post-map cat="-1"] or  <?php echo do_shortcode('[codepeople-post-map cat="-1"]'); ?> for template.

Note 4:	To display all points that belong to the posts with a specific tag assigned, for example the tag name "mytag", use the shortcode's attribute "tag", like follows: [codepeople-post-map tag="mytag"]. To insert the code directly in a template, the snippet of code is:

            <?php echo do_shortcode('[codepeople-post-map tag="mytag"]'); ?>
			
If you prefer configure your map directly from the shortcode, then you must enter an attribute for each map feature to specify. For example:
            
            [codepeople-post-map width="500" height="500"]

The complete list of allowed attributes are:

Very Important. Some of attributes are available only in the premium version of the plugin.
            
width:  Values allowed, number or percentage. Defines the map's width. [codepeople-post-map width="300"] or [codepeople-post-map width="100%"]

align:  Values allowed, left, right, center. Aligns the map's container to the left, right or center. [codepeople-post-map align="center"]

defaultpost: Defines the post ID, for centring the map, and display by default the infowindow corresponding to the first point associated to this post. [codepeople-post-map defaultpost="396"]

legend:  Accepts a taxonomy name as value. Some common taxonomies names are:  category and post_tag, for the categories and tags, respectively. Displays the legend with the list of elements that belong to the taxonomy and are assigned to the posts associated with the points. [codepeople-post-map legend="category"]

legend_title:  Text to be used as legend title. [codepeople-post-map legend="category" legend_title="Select the categories to display on map"]

legend_class:  Class name to be assigned to the legend. The legend design may be modified through CSS styles. Creates a class name, with the styles definition, and associates the new class name to the legend through the legend_class attribute. [codepeople-post-map legend="category" legend_class="my-legend-class"]

tag:  Tags slugs separated by ",". Displays on map the points whose posts have assigned the tags.[codepeople-post-map tag="tag1,tag2,tag3"]

cat:  Categories IDs separated by "," or -1. Displays on map the points whose posts belong to the categories. The special value -1, allows display on map all points defined in the website.[codepeople-post-map cat="2,4,56"] [codepeople-post-map cat="-1"]

excludecat:  Categories IDs to exclude, separated by ",". From points to be displayed on map, the plugin excludes the points whose posts belong to the categories to exclude. [codepeople-post-map tag="tag1,tag2" excludecat="4"]

excludepost:  Posts IDs to exclude separated by ",". [codepeople-post-map cat="-1" excludepost="235,260"]

excludetag:  Tags IDs to exclude separated by ",". [codepeople-post-map excludetag="2,13"]

taxonomy:  The taxonomy is a special attribute that should be combined with other attributes, depending of taxonomies to use for points filtering. Suppose the website includes two new taxonomies:  taxonomyA and taxonomyB, and the map should display all points that belong to the posts with the value T1 for taxonomyA, and T3,T4 for taxonomyB, the shortcode would be:  [codepeople-post-map taxonomy="taxonomyA,taxonomyB" taxonomyA="T1" taxonomyB="t2,t3"]

Note 5: The geolocation information is stored in image's metadata from mobiles or cameras with GPS devices.

Note 6: Some plugins interfere with the shortcodes replacements, and provokes that maps don't be loaded correctly, in this case should be passed a new parameter through the shortcode print=1

Passing the parameter print=1, displays the map at beginning of page/post content.

Note 7: To display all points in posts with a specific taxonomy assigned, or multiple taxonomies, should be used the "taxonomy" attribute in the shortcode, with the list of all taxonomies separated by the comma symbol, for example: taxonomy="taxonomy1,taxonomy2", and a new attribute for each taxonomy with the values corresponding. For example if you want select the points that belong to the posts with the values: "value1" for "taxonomy1", the shortcode would be: [codepeople-post-map taxonomy="taxonomy1" taxonomy1="value1"], for multiple taxonomies: [codepeople-post-map taxonomy="taxonomy1,taxonomy2" taxonomy1="value1" taxonomy2="value2,value3"].

A: If after pressing the "verify" button, the address is modified dynamically, and the pin is displayed in another location, the cause is simple. If Google does not recognize an address, it uses the nearest known address, and displays the pin on this location. 

To solve the issue, you simply should drag and drop the pin in the correct location, and type the address again, but this time "DON'T PRESS AGAIN THE VERIFY BUTTON".

        ]       
        
= Q: I've inserted an image in the page, but have not been generated a new point in the map =

A: First, be sure you have checked the option "Generate points dynamically from geolocation information included on images, when images are uploaded to WordPress", from the settings page of the plugin.

Second, be sure the image includes the Exif tags with the geolocation information (latitude and longitude)

Finally, you should upload the image from the "Add Media" button of the page or post, and not from the media library.
