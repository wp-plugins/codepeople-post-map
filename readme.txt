== Description ==

Google Map features:

	► Insert a Google map in the best position within your blog

**CP Google Maps** allows to insert a Google Maps in a post or in any of the WordPress templates that display multiple posts.

Note 1: To display all points that belong to a specific category, it is required to insert the following shortcode [codepeople-post-map cat="3"]. The number 3 represent the category ID, replace this number by the corresponding category's ID. To insert the code directly in a template, the snippet of code is:

            <?php echo do_shortcode('[codepeople-post-map cat="3"]'); ?>
			
Note 2:	To display all points that belong to more than one category, separate the categories IDs with the comma symbol [codepeople-post-map cat="3,5"]. The numbers 3 y 5 are the categories IDs, replace these numbers by the corresponding categories IDs. To insert the code directly in a template, the snippet of code is:

            <?php echo do_shortcode('[codepeople-post-map cat="3,5"]'); ?>
            
Note 3: To display all points in the website, use -1 as the category's ID: [codepeople-post-map cat="-1"] or  <?php echo do_shortcode('[codepeople-post-map cat="-1"]'); ?> for template.

Note 4:	To display all points that belong to the posts with a specific tag assigned, for example the tag name "mytag", use the shortcode's attribute "tag", like follows: [codepeople-post-map tag="mytag"]. To insert the code directly in a template, the snippet of code is:

            <?php echo do_shortcode('[codepeople-post-map tag="mytag"]'); ?>
			
If you prefer configure your map directly from the shortcode, then you must enter an attribute for each map feature to specify. For example:
            
            [codepeople-post-map width="500" height="500"]

The complete list of allowed attributes are:
            
           width: the map's width.
		   height: the map's height.
		   zoom: the map's zoom.
		   dynamic_zoom: adjust zoom dynamically, allowed values: 0, 1
		   zoompancontrol: display or not the zoom control, allowed values: 0, 1
		   typecontrol: display the type control, allowed values: 0, 1
		   mousewheel: enable the mouse wheel, allowed values: 0, 1
		   streetviewcontrol: enable the street view control, allowed values: 0, 1 
		   route: display the route between points.
		   show_window: enable/disable the infowindows
		   show_default: open infowindow by default
		   mode: DRIVING, BICYCLING, TRANSIT, WALKING
		   tag: tags slugs separated by ","
		   cat: categories IDs separated by "," or -1
		   excludecat: categories to exclude separated by ","
		   excludepost: posts to exclude separated by ","
		   excludetag: tags to exclude, with the tags IDs separated by "," 

Note 5: The geolocation information is stored in image's metadata from mobiles or cameras with GPS devices.

Note 6: Some plugins interfere with the shortcodes replacements, and provokes that maps don't be loaded correctly, in this case should be passed a new parameter through the shortcode print=1

Passing the parameter print=1, displays the map at beginning of page/post content.
